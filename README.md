# Personal collection of EAR notifications

The United States has Encryption and Export Administration Regulations (EAR). 

Publicly available source code is not subject to EAR, once an email notification is sent to `crypt@bis.doc.gov` and to `enc@nsa.gov`.

A more in-depth discussion is from [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/us-export-controls-and-published-encryption-source-code-explained).
